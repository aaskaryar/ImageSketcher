      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals in the world and are native to Africa. They are easily recognized by their long necks, spots, and long legs.</p>

      <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
      <p>Giraffes have a unique neck structure that allows them to reach leaves and branches that other animals cannot. The neck of a giraffe contains the same number of vertebrae as other mammals, but each vertebra is elongated. Their legs alone are taller than most people, measuring up to six feet in length!</p>
      <p>Giraffes also have a distinctive coat pattern, with each individual having a unique set of spots. Their spots are much like fingerprints and can be used to identify them.</p>

      <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
      <p>Giraffes are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa and prefer savannas, open woodlands, and forests. They are well adapted to their environment and can go for long periods without water, getting most of the moisture they need from the leaves they eat.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Conservation</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, giraffe populations have declined in recent years due to habitat loss and poaching. Today, they are listed as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts are underway to protect giraffes and their habitats and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>
